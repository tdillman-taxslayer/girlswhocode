# Girls Who Code

Welcome to Girls Who Code.  As we trek along this 9 week journey, we will add any relevant documentation, lessons, and of course, code.  

You can use this code as you please and we do not require any credit to be given.  So feel free to use anything you see in here for your own personal websites or apps you create!!!

## Lesson Plans and Notes

During our lessons, we will include under the `notes` folder, quick reference summaries of what we went over in class.  You may use this to review or suppliment your lessons if you cannot make it to a session.  We will try to include additional matterial for you to review as well for your own personal gain.  **Remember**, no one is good at coding at first.  Coding is a craft which takes time and effort to truly master.  So don't get discouraged, always ask questions, and don't be afraid to ask for help!  Most of the development community is very open and receptive to new programmers.
