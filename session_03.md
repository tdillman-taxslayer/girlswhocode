### HTML Overview

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
```

Html or **hypertext markup language** is what allows the web to look the way it does.  Think of HTML as the visual definition of what a web page is supposed to look like.  Its a way for a programmer to describe to the browser what a website should look like

A superset of HTML is XML or **Extensible Markup Language**

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

Notice how the tag **html** wraps head and body. Most tags in HTML have an opening `<tag>` and a closing `</tag>`.  You know its an opening tag because it does not have a `</` in between the `< >` symbols. 

There are many important tags in html.  Some common tags are...

1. `<p>`
2. `<div>`
3. `<h1>`

You can think of a `<div>` as a **divider** of other html elements. 

One thing the browser does is read the html file from top to bottom and arranges the elements as such.
