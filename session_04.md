# HTML and HTTP

### HTML Forms

Are one way we as developers gather data from our users.  You've probably ran into a form at some point or another on websites such as Instagram or Facebook.  Whenever you login to a website, that is a form.  You type in some text and usually hit the "login" button.  

A form has the opening tag of `<form>` and a closing tag of `</form>`. 

```
<form>
  First name: <br>
  <input type="text"> name="firstname"><br>
  Last name:<br>
  <input type="text" name="lastname">
</form>
```
